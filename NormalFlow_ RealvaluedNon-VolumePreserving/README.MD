# RealNVP Readme

## Overview
This repository contains code implementing RealNVP (Real Non-Volume Preserving), a neural network model introduced by Dinh et al. in 2017. RealNVP is designed to transform complex data distributions into simple Gaussians while maintaining invertibility and facilitating the calculation of the Jacobian matrix.

## Summary
RealNVP was introduced as a generative model capable of transforming intricate data distributions into simpler Gaussian forms. The provided code demonstrates the implementation of RealNVP on the Two Moons dataset, creating a Jupyter notebook for the example. The dataset is generated using the `make_moons` function from the sklearn Python library.

### Key Components
1. **Coupling Layers:** RealNVP employs coupling layers, producing scaling and translation factors for each input element. These layers are stacked to create a custom Coupling layer in Keras.

2. **Masking and Transformation:** Coupling layers use masking and transformation processes to achieve a simple Jacobian matrix, enabling efficient determinant computation.

3. **Training Process:** The model is trained to learn the distribution of the Two Moons dataset by minimizing the negative log-likelihood. The target output distribution is set to a standard Gaussian.

4. **Stacking Coupling Layers:** To address the issue of leaving some elements unchanged during transformation, multiple coupling layers are stacked with alternating masking patterns, allowing for learning more complex representations.

## Code Structure
The code is organized in a Jupyter notebook. Refer to the notebook for the RealNVP implementation.

## Dataset
The Two Moons dataset is utilized for this example, created by the `make_moons` function from sklearn. It generates a noisy 2D dataset resembling two crescents.

## How to Run
To run the code, open the provided Jupyter notebook. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute and visualize the RealNVP model on the Two Moons dataset.

## Dependencies
Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed, including Keras, TensorFlow, and sklearn. The code may reference additional dependencies, so review the notebook for any specific requirements.

## Next Steps
The RealNVP model presented here is a specific case of normalizing flow generative models. The README concludes by mentioning that the next section will cover modern normalizing flow models, extending the ideas introduced in the RealNVP paper.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to gain a deeper understanding of RealNVP and its applications. Happy coding!
