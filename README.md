## Project Structure



### Model Reviews

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

The CNN model is a cornerstone in computer vision applications, effectively capturing spatial hierarchies in data. Review the CNN implementation in the `models/cnn` directory.

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

RNNs excel in sequential data processing, making them ideal for natural language processing and time-series analysis. Explore the RNN model in the `models/rnn` directory.

#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs are powerful for generating realistic synthetic data by training a generator and discriminator simultaneously. Dive into the GAN model in the `models/gans` directory.

#### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

VAEs are probabilistic generative models that encode and decode data with a focus on latent space representations. Examine the VAE model in the `models/vae` directory.

#### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTM models are designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, enhancing the capabilities of standard RNNs. Check out the LSTM model in the `models/lstm` directory.

### Model Comparisons

Compare and contrast the reviewed models in terms of architecture, use cases, and performance in the `models/comparisons` directory.

## Results

Check out the `results/` directory for visualizations, generated samples, and evaluation metrics.
